SF1DISASM-patches
=================

A disassembly of the game "Shining Force" for documentation and fan-project purposes, which can be assembled back into a bit-perfect replica of the original rom file.

This fork incorporates build options for the purpose of producing IPS patches that can be applied to the original rom while preserving compatibility with [SF1Edit](https://github.com/ShiningForceCentral/SF1Edit).

The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/ShiningForceCentral/SF1DISASM).


The purpose of this project will be to provide a disassembly of Shining Force with the following goals in mind : 
- Documenting as much content of the game as possible, to get a perfect understanding of how it works.
- Being able to re-assemble the game and obtain the same rom file as the original game.
- Giving fan-projects the ability to start from this disassembly by editing the game's code and assets.


Documentation : 
Providing documentation of the game will be done mainly in two ways : 
- Commenting the disassembly's ASM code, proper formatting and splitting of binary data.
- A wiki is attached to the project for everything else : rom map, ram map, data indexes, data formats, algorithms ...


Re-assembly : 
By providing the original US rom file of the game, one will be able to use the provided tools in order to :
- with split/split.bat, split the original rom file into a lot of small binary data files, to extract data chunks which are not included in the disassembly
- with build/build.bat, assemble the game from its disassembly and the extracted data chunks
The assembled game will be perfectly identical to the original one. 

Starting point for fan projects :
It should be possible to start from this disassembly to modify the game's data and mechanics. 
- The game data obtained with split.bat can be edited individually before being included in the game with build.bat.
- The game's code can be edited in the disassembly. Beware : ASM 68k writing skills required !
